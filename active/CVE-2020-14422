 https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/20956
Description:
 Lib/ipaddress.py in Python through 3.8.3 improperly computes hash values in
 the IPv4Interface and IPv6Interface classes, which might allow a remote
 attacker to cause a denial of service if an application is affected by the
 performance of a dictionary containing IPv4Interface or IPv6Interface
 objects, and this attacker can cause many dictionary entries to be created.
