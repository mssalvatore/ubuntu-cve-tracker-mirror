Description:
 Hugo is a fast and Flexible Static Site Generator built in Go. Hugo depends
 on Go's `os/exec` for certain features, e.g. for rendering of Pandoc
 documents if these binaries are found in the system `%PATH%` on Windows. In
 Hugo before version 0.79.1, if a malicious file with the same name (`exe`
 or `bat`) is found in the current working directory at the time of running
 `hugo`, the malicious command will be invoked instead of the system one.
 Windows users who run `hugo` inside untrusted Hugo sites are affected.
 Users should upgrade to Hugo v0.79.1. Other than avoiding untrusted Hugo
 sites, there is no workaround.
