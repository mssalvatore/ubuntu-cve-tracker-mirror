Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due to
 incorrect data validation, HTTP Request Splitting attacks may succeed
 against HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This leads to cache poisoning. This allows
 any client, including browser scripts, to bypass local security and poison
 the browser cache and any downstream caches with content from an arbitrary
 source. Squid uses a string search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding
 header to find chunked encoding. This allows an attacker to hide a second
 request inside Transfer-Encoding: it is interpreted by Squid as chunked and
 split out into a second request delivered upstream. Squid will then deliver
 two distinct responses to the client, corrupting any downstream caches.
