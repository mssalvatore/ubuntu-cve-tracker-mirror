Description:
 FreedomBox through 20.13 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information from the /server-status page of the Apache HTTP Server, because
 a connection from the Tor onion service (or from PageKite) is considered a
 local connection. This affects both the freedombox and plinth packages of
 some Linux distributions, but only if the Apache mod_status module is
 enabled.
