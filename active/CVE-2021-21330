Description:
 aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and
 Python. In aiohttp before version 3.7.4 there is an open redirect
 vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link to an aiohttp-based web-server
 could redirect the browser to a different website. It is caused by a bug in
 the `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` middleware. This
 security problem has been fixed in 3.7.4. Upgrade your dependency using pip
 as follows "pip install aiohttp >= 3.7.4". If upgrading is not an option
 for you, a workaround can be to avoid using
 `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` in your applications.
