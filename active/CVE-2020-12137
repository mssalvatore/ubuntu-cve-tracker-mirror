Description:
 GNU Mailman 2.x before 2.1.30 uses the .obj extension for scrubbed
 application/octet-stream MIME parts. This behavior may contribute to XSS
 attacks against list-archive visitors, because an HTTP reply from an
 archive web server may lack a MIME type, and a web browser may perform MIME
 sniffing, conclude that the MIME type should have been text/html, and
 execute JavaScript code.
