Description:
 In /MagickCore/statistic.c, there are several areas in
 ApplyEvaluateOperator() where a size_t cast should have been a ssize_t
 cast, which causes out-of-range values under some circumstances when a
 crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. Red Hat Product Security
 marked this as Low severity because although it could potentially lead to
 an impact to application availability, no specific impact was shown in this
 case. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 6.9.10-69.
