Description:
 In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, certain directory paths are
 created (etcd data directory and the directory path when provided to
 automatically generate self-signed certificates for TLS connections with
 clients) with restricted access permissions (700) by using the os.MkdirAll.
 This function does not perform any permission checks when a given directory
 path exists already. A possible workaround is to ensure the directories
 have the desired permission (700).
