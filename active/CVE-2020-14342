Description:
 It was found that cifs-utils' mount.cifs was invoking a shell when
 requesting the Samba password, which could be used to inject arbitrary
 commands. An attacker able to invoke mount.cifs with special permission,
 such as via sudo rules, could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.
