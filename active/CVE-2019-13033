Description:
 In CISOfy Lynis 2.x through 2.7.5, the license key can be obtained by
 looking at the process list when a data upload is being performed. This
 license can be used to upload data to a central Lynis server. Although no
 data can be extracted by knowing the license key, it may be possible to
 upload the data of additional scans.
