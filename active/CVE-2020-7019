Description:
 In Elasticsearch before 7.9.0 and 6.8.12 a field disclosure flaw was found
 when running a scrolling search with Field Level Security. If a user runs
 the same query another more privileged user recently ran, the scrolling
 search can leak fields that should be hidden. This could result in an
 attacker gaining additional permissions against a restricted index.
