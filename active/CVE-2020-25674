 https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1715
Description:
 WriteOnePNGImage() from coders/png.c (the PNG coder) has a for loop with an
 improper exit condition that can allow an out-of-bounds READ via
 heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs because it is possible for the colormap
 to have less than 256 valid values but the loop condition will loop 256
 times, attempting to pass invalid colormap data to the event logger. The
 patch replaces the hardcoded 256 value with a call to MagickMin() to ensure
 the proper value is used. This could impact application availability when a
 specially crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This flaw affects
 ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.
