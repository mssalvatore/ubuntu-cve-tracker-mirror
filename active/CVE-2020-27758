Description:
 A flaw was found in ImageMagick in coders/txt.c. An attacker who submits a
 crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined
 behavior in the form of values outside the range of type `unsigned long
 long`. This would most likely lead to an impact to application
 availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to
 undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to
 7.0.8-68.
