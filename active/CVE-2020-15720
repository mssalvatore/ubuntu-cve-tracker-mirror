Description:
 In Dogtag PKI through 10.8.3, the pki.client.PKIConnection class did not
 enable python-requests certificate validation. Since the verify parameter
 was hard-coded in all request functions, it was not possible to override
 the setting. As a result, tools making use of this class, such as the
 pki-server command, may have been vulnerable to Person-in-the-Middle
 attacks in certain non-localhost use cases. This is fixed in 10.9.0-b1.
