Description:
 An issue was discovered in certain configurations of GNOME gnome-shell
 through 3.36.4. When logging out of an account, the password box from the
 login dialog reappears with the password still visible. If the user had
 decided to have the password shown in cleartext at login time, it is then
 visible for a brief moment upon a logout. (If the password were never shown
 in cleartext, only the password length is revealed.)
