Description:
 An issue was discovered in channels/chan_sip.c in Sangoma Asterisk through
 13.29.1, through 16.6.1, and through 17.0.0; and Certified Asterisk through
 13.21-cert4. A SIP request can be sent to Asterisk that can change a SIP
 peer's IP address. A REGISTER does not need to occur, and calls can be
 hijacked as a result. The only thing that needs to be known is the peer's
 name; authentication details such as passwords do not need to be known.
 This vulnerability is only exploitable when the nat option is set to the
 default, or auto_force_rport.
