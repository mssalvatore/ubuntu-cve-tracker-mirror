Description:
 Python 3.x through 3.9.1 has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in
 _ctypes/callproc.c, which may lead to remote code execution in certain
 Python applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted input,
 as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to c_double.from_param. This occurs
 because sprintf is used unsafely.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> on Ubuntu, binaries are compiled with Fortify Source, so
 mdeslaur> exploiting this issue will likely only cause Python to crash,
 mdeslaur> leading to a denial of service.
