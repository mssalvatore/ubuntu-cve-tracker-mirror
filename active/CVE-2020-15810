Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due to
 incorrect data validation, HTTP Request Smuggling attacks may succeed
 against HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This leads to cache poisoning. This allows
 any client, including browser scripts, to bypass local security and poison
 the proxy cache and any downstream caches with content from an arbitrary
 source. When configured for relaxed header parsing (the default), Squid
 relays headers containing whitespace characters to upstream servers. When
 this occurs as a prefix to a Content-Length header, the frame length
 specified will be ignored by Squid (allowing for a conflicting length to be
 used from another Content-Length header) but relayed upstream.
