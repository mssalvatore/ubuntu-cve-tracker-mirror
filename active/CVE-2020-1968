Description:
 The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead
 to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections
 which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case
 this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted
 communications sent over that TLS connection. The attack can only be
 exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across multiple TLS
 connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH
 ciphersuites. This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support and
 no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this
 issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2w (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2v).
