Description:
 In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.0.3 and before 3.5.0, passing
 HTML containing <option> elements from untrusted sources - even after
 sanitizing it - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(),
 .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code. This problem is patched
 in jQuery 3.5.0.
