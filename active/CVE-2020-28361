Description:
 Kamailio before 5.4.0, as used in Sip Express Router (SER) in Sippy
 Softswitch 4.5 through 5.2 and other products, allows a bypass of a
 header-removal protection mechanism via whitespace characters. This occurs
 in the remove_hf function in the Kamailio textops module. Particular use of
 remove_hf in Sippy Softswitch may allow skilled attacker having a valid
 credential in the system to disrupt internal call start/duration accounting
 mechanisms leading potentially to a loss of revenue.
