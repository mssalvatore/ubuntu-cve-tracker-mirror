Description:
 avahi-daemon-check-dns.sh in the Debian avahi package through 0.8-4 is
 executed as root via /etc/network/if-up.d/avahi-daemon, and allows a local
 attacker to cause a denial of service or create arbitrary empty files via a
 symlink attack on files under /run/avahi-daemon. NOTE: this only affects
 the packaging for Debian GNU/Linux (used indirectly by SUSE), not the
 upstream Avahi product.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> the script was removed in the 0.7-4ubuntu7 package in focal.
 mdeslaur> for bionic and earlier, we can't simply remove the script as
 mdeslaur> libnss-mdns is too old there.
