Description:
 GNU Bison before 3.5.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash). NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used with
 untrusted input, and an observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with
 a specific compiler/architecture. The bug reports were intended to show
 that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code
 that is generated by Bison.
