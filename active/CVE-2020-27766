Description:
 A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/statistic.c. An attacker who
 submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger
 undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type
 `unsigned long`. This would most likely lead to an impact to application
 availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to
 undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to
 7.0.8-69.
