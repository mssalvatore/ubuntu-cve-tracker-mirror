 https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1731
Description:
 In the CropImage() and CropImageToTiles() routines of
 MagickCore/transform.c, rounding calculations performed on unconstrained
 pixel offsets was causing undefined behavior in the form of integer
 overflow and out-of-range values as reported by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.
 Such issues could cause a negative impact to application availability or
 other problems related to undefined behavior, in cases where ImageMagick
 processes untrusted input data. The upstream patch introduces functionality
 to constrain the pixel offsets and prevent these issues. This flaw affects
 ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
