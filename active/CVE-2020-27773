 https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1739
Description:
 A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/gem-private.h. An attacker
 who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger
 undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type
 `unsigned char` or division by zero. This would most likely lead to an
 impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other
 problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick
 versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
