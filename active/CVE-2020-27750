 https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1711
Description:
 A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/colorspace-private.h and
 MagickCore/quantum.h. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is
 processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of
 values outside the range of type `unsigned char` and math division by zero.
 This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but
 could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This
 flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.
