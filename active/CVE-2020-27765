Description:
 A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/segment.c. An attacker who
 submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger
 undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most
 likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially
 cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects
 ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
